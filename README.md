# phac-dns
## What & Why
We are modernizing our data management at the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) by implementing a DNS repository that allows for PHAC-controlled DNS delegation. This initiative includes a self-service system for naming data services and web properties, ensuring easy access and management. Furthermore, we have introduced a tiered naming system to reflect the maturity of our Data Science Teams (DST). Central to this modernization is our "As Data" approach, which utilizes KCC YAML to describe DNS entries, facilitating automated analysis and governance across our service ecosystem. This method enhances the efficiency and oversight of our digital infrastructure, aligning with contemporary data management practices.
